An advanced AI-powered question analysis system was formulated, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models to accurately process and categorize educational content from PDF files. A comprehensive classification framework was implemented to systematically sort questions into five specific categories: one-word answers, true/false, multiple-choice, short-answer, and long-answer formats, thereby improving the organization and accessibility of educational materials. A Python-based solution was created, incorporating external knowledge retrieval methods to facilitate efficient processing of educational content and offer a scalable solution for automated content analysis and question categorization.
